## contiguous average


i. Given an array, find the average of all contiguous subarrays of size "K" in it.
ii. Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number 'k', find the maximum sum  of any contiguous subarray of size k.
iii. Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number `S`, find the length of the smallest contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to `S`. Return 0 if no such subarray exists.
iv. Given a string, find the length of the longest substring in it with no more than k distinct characters.
v. Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, you are given 2 baskets and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.
vi. Given a string, find the length of the longest substring which has no repeating characters.
vii. You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times. Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations. 
viii. Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.
